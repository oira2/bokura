The Meeting
<h1>Day 7: The Meeting</h1>
<p>For the first time since they arrived in the Emerald Forest, it was Gabu who woke Mei up on the day the meeting was scheduled to take place, the goat having slept late into the day on account of the long day yesterday.</p>
<p>When it was time for the meeting, Gabu and Mei made their way to the prearranged spot. There they found Greta, Sagi, Toto and Riri waiting a good distance away from the edge of the forest. The forest edge did indeed look just like it had on the day Gabu and Mei had jumped into the river together; countless curious faces poked out from between the trees, and birds and squirrels crowded the branches. Many of them drew back slightly when they saw Gabu approaching, but they remained close enough to hear what would be said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gabu and Mei, thank you for coming,&rdquo; Greta said as they approached. Mei noticed that Greta spoke in a louder voice than she would have done if they were alone, presumably for the benefit of those listening from the trees.</p>
<p>Mei answered in an equally loud voice. &ldquo;Thank you for arranging the meeting, Greta. Is everyone ready to start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greta nodded, but before she could say anything else, Sagi said, &ldquo;Mei, why did you lie to us? Did you have any idea what you were doing, bringing a wolf to our forest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Sagi,&rdquo; Greta said. &ldquo;I, too, dislike the fact that we were misled, and I take very seriously the danger that a wolf&rsquo;s presence brings. But I fully understand why Mei chose to tell us in the manner that he did, and I&rsquo;m grateful that he told us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gabu chose that moment to speak up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry for any problems I&rsquo;ve caused by being here. If there was any way I could avoid having to eat meat, I would. I don&rsquo;t like it any more than you do.&rdquo; There were curious murmurs from the crowd at this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Gabu,&rdquo; Greta said. &ldquo;While we appreciate that you can&rsquo;t help being a wolf, the fact of the matter is that you being here is a source of great concern for many of us in the forest. I&rsquo;d like to start by voicing some—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; Riri interrupted. Greta went silent and looked inquisitively at the sparrow. &ldquo;The six of us know the reason why Gabu and Mei are here in the first place but, as far as I&rsquo;m aware, no one else does. Don&rsquo;t you think it would be better to start with everyone on the same page?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make a good point,&rdquo; Greta said. &ldquo;Very well. Gabu and Mei, would you two care to tell everyone assembled here how it was you came to be here in the forest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gabu and Mei turned toward the forest edge and began recounting the story, together this time, of how they met, became friends, fled their homes and ended up in the Emerald Forest. Mei was a little nervous telling the story to such a large audience, most of whom he could barely see amidst the shade of the trees. Gabu, on the other hand, told his parts of the story with such confidence and emotion that Mei was convinced he must have been practising since he recited it to the sparrows the other day.</p>
<p>The audience, dubious at first at why they were being told about an abandoned barn in a forest they&rsquo;d never seen, became more and more intrigued as the story went on. Gradually, some animals started creeping forward, out of the trees, to be able to hear better. It gladdened Mei to see them getting used to Gabu&rsquo;s presence so soon.</p>
<p>The events that transpired at the top of the mountain remained the most difficult for Mei to tell, especially since he was emphasising the most emotional aspects for dramatic effect. Unlike when he&rsquo;d told the story to his four friends, he left out no details. When Mei described how he&rsquo;d asked Gabu to eat him in the snow cave, and when Gabu described the emotional meltdown he&rsquo;d experienced at having to choose between eating his friend and both of them dying, none of the eyes watching from the forest were free of tears.</p>
<p>The only thing Gabu and Mei didn&rsquo;t tell their audience explicitly was that they were lovers. Mei was worried that that kind of relationship between a goat and a wolf would be too much for some people in the audience to handle; his herd had reacted badly enough thinking they were just friends. Mei tried to make it as clear as possible that their relationship was romantic without saying so explicitly, and he was fairly sure that anyone paying close enough attention would get the idea.</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;d finished the story, Mei said, &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here. Our old homes—our own family and friends—kicked us out because they didn&rsquo;t believe that a goat and a wolf could be together. And we almost died, so many times, trying to find a place that would accept us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as it was clear Gabu and Mei had nothing more to say, the animals listening from the edge of the forest began talking animatedly amongst themselves. It took Greta a few moments to regain everyone&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Gabu and Mei. Now that everyone understands the circumstances that brought you here, I think it&rsquo;s time to hear any concerns the residents of the forest may have about your presence.&rdquo; She turned to address the animals at the edge of the forest. &ldquo;Does anyone have anything to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One squirrel came as far forward as she dared and asked, &ldquo;Will there be any more wolves coming to the forest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Gabu replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been months since the avalanche, so it looks like the other wolves have given up chasing us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That seemed to satisfy the squirrel, who scampered back into the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone else?&rdquo; Greta asked. The crowd was silent. Greta repeated her question, but again no one answered. &ldquo;I spoke to dozens of animals yesterday about their concerns regarding the wolf&rsquo;s presence in the forest. Surely some of you are here now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Riri said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not as big a deal as you think it is. There are hundreds of predators in the forest already. What difference does one more make?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you can see that a wolf presents a unique danger, one that hasn&rsquo;t existed in this forest for as long as anyone can remember? Many of us are deeply concerned that we must now constantly worry about being eaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, Greta,&rdquo; Toto said, &ldquo;most of us have always had to worry about being eaten. Just because you&rsquo;re too large for a fox or a badger to kill doesn&rsquo;t mean this forest has always been perfectly safe for us smaller animals.&rdquo; Many of the animals at the forest edge agreed with Toto&rsquo;s words, chittering and chirping in affirmation.</p>
<p>Greta looked around at the assembled animals, seeming to only now realise that she was vastly outnumbered by animals smaller than herself. &ldquo;Th—thank you, Toto. Perhaps I have been letting my own experiences... That is to say, you&rsquo;re right. I apologise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still think one more predator is one predator too many,&rdquo; Sagi said. &ldquo;This wolf has been disproportionately targeting the side of the forest where my sister&rsquo;s family happens to live. People are dying every day because of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sagi,&rdquo; Gabu said. The rabbit, realising the wolf&rsquo;s attention was on him, jumped back in alarm. &ldquo;I am truly sorry for every life I have to take, but I really do have no choice. If I don&rsquo;t eat meat, I&rsquo;ll starve. What would you do if you were in my position?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d... I&rsquo;d...&rdquo; Sagi seemed to panic slightly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, all right? I don&rsquo;t think I could live with myself if I had to cause that much suffering. I would... I would starve myself,&rdquo; Sagi said decisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s your choice. But I&rsquo;m the one who has to make that choice for myself and, personally, I&rsquo;d rather live than die.&rdquo; Mei was slightly alarmed that Gabu even considered that a choice. &ldquo;I think most animals would make the same decision. That doesn&rsquo;t make them bad people, does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well said,&rdquo; Riri said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; Greta said. She turned her attention back to the edge of the forest. &ldquo;Now, is anyone here opposed to Gabu and Mei becoming permanent residents of our forest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Mei&rsquo;s amazement, not a single person raised their voice in opposition. Even Sagi remained quiet, perhaps still pondering what Gabu had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then. Gabu and Mei, I&rsquo;m pleased to welcome you to our forest. You may stay as long as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Greta concluded the meeting by telling Gabu he was free to hunt in the forest as he pleased, but warned him against hunting in some areas more than others, lest the animals there grow resentful. Gabu agreed to this, which seemed to appease Sagi somewhat.</p>
<p>A number of animals wanted to know when the next meeting would be, curious to learn more about the goat and the wolf they would now be living alongside. Greta promised to ask around and see if there was widespread support for more meetings in the future.</p>
<p>Gabu and Mei retired to Moonrise Hill to discuss what had just happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;re really okay with us being here,&rdquo; Gabu said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither can I. If only my herd, or your pack, had been so supportive of us.&rdquo; That gave Mei an idea. &ldquo;Hey, Gabu, how long do you suppose it would take the sparrows to fly over the mountain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably less than a day, I think. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Toto and Riri would be willing to carry a message to Sawa Sawa Mountain and back? My herd probably doesn&rsquo;t know we&rsquo;re still alive; I doubt the wolves would have told them otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a really good Idea, Mei. Do you think your herd would welcome you back after everything that&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go back to living with them, at least not permanently. But I want them to know that they were wrong not to trust you, and there are a few people there who would want to know I&rsquo;m okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can ask them about it in the morning—the sparrows, I mean. Goodnight, Mei.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodnight, Gabu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the full moon high in the sky, Gabu and Mei's new life has just begun. But can they live happily ever after in a forest that never expected a goat and a wolf to move in next door? This story picks up where the movie left off, chronicling Gabu and Mei's endeavour to make friends and come to terms with Gabu's nature in the months following their reunion.<p>
<p>Loosely inspired by Ringcaat's fanfic "Beyond the Storm". Canon comes mostly from the movie, and occasionally from the television series, the original books, and the trilogy of additional stories published in 2011/2012.</p>

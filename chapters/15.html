<h1>Day 14: Goodbyes</h1>
<p>The following morning, after a lengthy discussion with Gabu the previous night, Mei had made up his mind. He headed into the forest and found Greta, who helped him track down Toto, Riri and Sagi. The five friends met together in a clearing, the first time all five of them had spoken alone since Mei had told them about Gabu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to hand it to you, Mei. I never thought I&rsquo;d actually enjoy spending time with a wolf,&rdquo; Sagi said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear the meetings have been going well,&rdquo; Riri said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is truly remarkable how your and Gabu&rsquo;s presence here has brought together so many animals who would never ordinarily talk to one another,&rdquo; Greta said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Mei said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really grateful to all of you for sticking with Gabu and me. This forest wouldn&rsquo;t feel like home without you here. The reason I wanted to talk to you all today before the meeting is that I&rsquo;ll be leaving the forest tomorrow, temporarily, to visit some people from my old herd. I&rsquo;m not sure how long I&rsquo;ll be gone; it might be a few months. Gabu will be staying here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really going away for that long, just to visit the herd that kicked you out?&rdquo; Sagi said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to visit the whole herd, just a few people who I think truly care about me. Toto, Riri, when you&rsquo;re ready to make the journey back over the mountain, could you take a message to my grandmother and Mii? I&rsquo;ll be going to Para Para Fields to meet Kuro-san, and I&rsquo;d like them to meet me there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Mei,&rdquo; Toto said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll also let Kuro-san know to expect you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised you&rsquo;re not taking Gabu with you,&rdquo; Greta said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only been a couple of weeks since the two of you were reunited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gabu and I have talked about that at length and decided it would be best if I go alone. As much as I&rsquo;d like him to meet my grandmother and my friends, I&rsquo;d rather take things slowly with them for now. And after all, someone has to keep the group going while I&rsquo;m gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later that day, at the meeting, Mei made the same announcement to the rest of the group. Everyone who had gotten to know him over the past week was saddened to learn that Mei would be absent for so long, but they all agreed that it would do Mei good to see his family again and get some closure if he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As this is the last time we&rsquo;ll see you for a while,&rdquo; Takkan said, &ldquo;perhaps we could do something fun together for the rest of the meeting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you have in mind?&rdquo; Mei asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since clovers have a special significance to you and Gabu, I&rsquo;ve just remembered a song we could all learn that I think you&rsquo;d like. It&rsquo;s called &lsquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Roll+Me+Over+in+the+Clover">Roll Me Over in the Clover</a>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds like an excellent idea,&rdquo; Greta said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Mei said.</p>
<p>Once he had everyone&rsquo;s undivided attention, Takkan said, &ldquo;This is a call-and-response song. If I point at you, after I&rsquo;ve sung the verse, you sing the chorus, which goes like this.&rdquo; Takkan sang, &ldquo;<em>Roll me over in the clover, roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em> Let&rsquo;s practise that together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone followed Takkan&rsquo;s lead and sang, &ldquo;<em>Roll me over in the clover, roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo; It didn&rsquo;t sound great, but Takkan seemed satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get started, then. <em>Roll me over in the clover, roll me over lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo; Takkan pointed at Greta, who raised her eyebrows in surprise. &ldquo;<em>Well this is number one, and the fun has just begun. Roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greta, with some reluctance, sang, &ldquo;<em>Roll me over in the clover, roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mei was quite confident that he knew what kind of song this was.</p>
<p>Takkan pointed at Darrel, the stag. &ldquo;<em>Well this is number two, and the things they say are true. Roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leo joined in with Darrel as the two of them sang back, &ldquo;<em>Roll me over in the clover, roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Takkan pointed at Gabu and Mei. &ldquo;<em>Well these are three and four, they were looking for one more.</em>&rdquo; A few members of the audience laughed. Mei blushed profusely. Gabu didn&rsquo;t seem to understand. &ldquo;<em>Roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sang back, Gabu enthusiastically and Mei reluctantly, &ldquo;<em>Roll me over in the clover, roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The song continued for several more verses, Takkan pointing to a different person each time. Everyone, Mei included, was laughing and having fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Well this is number five, and he called out when he arrived. Roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Roll me over in the clover, roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Well this is number six, and she has the best of tricks. Roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Roll me over in the clover, roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Well this is number seven, and I now believe in heaven. Roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Roll me over in the clover, roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Well this is number eight, and it was hard to match her rate. Roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Roll me over in the clover, roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Well this is number nine, and his eyes are just divine. Roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Roll me over in the clover, roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Takkan finished by pointing to Sagi, singing the last verse more slowly. &ldquo;<em>Well this is number ten, and he now sleeps in my den. Roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Roll me over in the clover, roll me over, lay me down and do it again</em>,&rdquo; Sagi sang enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Takkan called out, &ldquo;Everyone sing the chorus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone sang, &ldquo;<em>Roll me over in the clover, roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herbivores only!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Roll me over in the clover, roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone who still doesn&rsquo;t get the joke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gabu started singing, &ldquo;<em>Roll me over in the...</em>&rdquo; but trailed off. &ldquo;Wait, am I the only one who doesn&rsquo;t get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mei mumbled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone, one last time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Roll me over in the clover, roll me over, lay me down and do it again.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the meeting had concluded, everyone still laughing and talking about Takkan&rsquo;s song, Gabu and Mei went back to their hill to spend the last night together they would have for a while. Over and over again, they told each other how much they loved each other and how much they would miss each other. Gabu was becoming increasingly distraught at the idea of Mei leaving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gabu, it&rsquo;s okay. This will be so much easier than the last time we spent apart, since we&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s not forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Gabu said, in tears at this point. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s still going to be difficult not knowing if you&rsquo;re safe. What if something happens and I&rsquo;m not there to protect you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mei laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been living in a forest full of wolves my entire life and nothing&rsquo;s happened to me yetâ€”until I met you, that is. And the Baku Baku wolf pack is in disarray, remember? It&rsquo;ll be safer than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wolves will be desperate, Mei. It would only take one wolf to notice you walking in the forest and, <em>chomp</em>, you&rsquo;d be eaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s lucky for me that I&rsquo;ve got plenty of experience dealing with wolves now. More than Tapu, at least.&rdquo; Mei stood up and paced around the cave. Suddenly, he pounced at Gabu, growling and shouting, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a wolf! I&rsquo;m going to eat you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gabu gave a theatrical yelp and allowed Mei to land on him. &ldquo;No, please! I&rsquo;m just a tasty goat. Don&rsquo;t eat me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They spent the rest of the evening laughing, crying and hugging each other until they&rsquo;d tired themselves out and finally fell asleep.</p>

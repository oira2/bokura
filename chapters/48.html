<p>The moment when it happens is a blur. Mei is wandering around the outskirts of the forest, waiting for Gabu to arrive, when out of nowhere, a grey wolf with a scar on its face starts charging towards him. Mei freezes. He barely has time to register, <em>Wait, that’s not Gabu</em>, when suddenly, Gabu’s there too.</p>
<p>“Mei!” Gabu cries in alarm. He’s running towards them, and just as the other wolf is lunging at Mei, Gabu leaps and catches the wolf hard on its side. Both of them go tumbling to the ground. Gabu recovers first and moves to stand protectively in front of Mei. “Get away from him!” Gabu says, and there’s a growl in his voice Mei has never heard before.</p>
<p>The unknown wolf struggles unsuccessfully to get to its feet. Its eyes dart between Gabu and Mei. “Goat,” it manages to say before falling unconscious. It’s got a scar on its hind leg too, a deep, vicious looking cut that must have happened in the last few days.</p>
<p>Gabu is panting heavily. Mei is shaking. “He must have fainted from that wound,” Gabu says. “At any rate, we’re fine now.”</p>
<p>Mei recovers from the shock enough to say, “We’re not fine. He saw the two of us together. Gabu, he knows about us now!”</p>
<p>Gabu’s eyes widen. “He’s not from my pack. Bari told me just before I left about these wolves from Gara Gara Mountain. They’re looking for a traitor who fled to this forest after attacking their leader. This must be him; he’s got the same scars Bari told me about.”</p>
<p>“Does that make a difference?” Mei says.</p>
<p>“It might do. If I talk to him and ask him not to tell anyone what he saw…”</p>
<p>Mei looks at the prone form of the wolf. “Okay. I’ll hide in the bushes while you talk to him. Be careful, all right?”</p>
<p>“I will, Mei.”</p>
<p>The wolf remains unconscious while Gabu finds some herbs and places them on the scar on his leg. Eventually, the wolf stirs, looking blearily up at Gabu. “You’re the guy from before,” he says, not in an accusatory tone. He tries again to stand, but it looks like the wound is causing him too much pain.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to tell your pack you were here,” Gabu says. His ears are down.</p>
<p>“You know about me?”</p>
<p>“You were wounded by your pack’s leader and ran away. Your name is Jess, right?”</p>
<p>The wolf glances at the herbs Gabu has put on his leg. “You know about me, and yet you still help me. Why?”</p>
<p>Gabu glances off to the side. “I might become a traitor too, all right?” Mei stifles a gasp. “That aside, there was something I wanted to ask you. It’s about what happened before you passed out.” </p>
<p>“You mean when I attacked that goat?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Did you see anything?”</p>
<p>Jess thinks. “I saw you and the goat. You said, ‘Mei’, or something.” Gabu’s head sags. “What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“I have a request for you. Please don’t tell anyone else about it.”</p>
<p>Jess seems confused. “About what?”</p>
<p>“About…me being friends with a goat.”</p>
<p>“Friends…with a goat?” Jess’s eyes widen. “Are you serious? Are you really friends with a goat?”</p>
<p>Mei can’t believe what he’s hearing. He jumps out of the bush he’s hiding in. “Gabu, why did you tell him that? Uh—” Both of the wolves are staring at him. No one moves. </p>

<p>“To think that you two could actually be friends.” Jess gives a short bark of a laugh. “I’m sorry. This has nothing to do with an outsider like me.” He’s recovered some of his strength, and the three of them are walking through the forest, trying to get Jess to the edge of the Baku Baku wolves’ territory without either of the wolf packs finding him.</p>
<p>Mei is in front. He leads them into the middle of a shallow stream, the water washing gently over their hooves and paws. They follow the stream for a while to disguise their tracks.</p>
<p>“It seems you two are experts at moving while hiding,” Jess says to Gabu.</p>
<p>“You could say that,” Gabu says.</p>
<p>“Although,” Jess lowers his voice, “you have a lot of self-control.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Gabu says.</p>
<p>“To be so close to such a delicious looking goat and not want to eat it.”</p>
<p>Mei continues walking forward, pretending not to hear. By the sound of it, Jess also has a lot of self-control, although Mei still looks subtly around for places to run to in case he’s mistaken.</p>
<p>“W-what are you talking about?” Gabu says unconvincingly. “Of course I don’t want to eat him.”</p>
<p>“You dislike goat?”</p>
<p>“I don’t dislike goat. I… I love…” Gabu trails off. “Look, Mei is different. He’s my best friend. I couldn’t possibly eat him.”</p>
<p>They leave the stream and stop walking to give Jess a chance to rest. He lies on the grass and closes his eyes.</p>
<p>“How’s your leg?” Gabu says.</p>
<p>“Better. The pain is fading, and the swelling seems to have gone down too.”</p>
<p>“Can I ask you something? Why did you try to attack your leader?” Jess opens his eyes and looks up at Gabu. “You don’t have to answer,” Gabu says quickly. “I was just curious.”</p>
<p>Jess thinks, and then sits up, the trace of a smile on his mouth. “I also had a friend like you two.” Mei, who has been keeping watch up ahead, looks back in curiosity. “His name was Gon. We were very close.</p>
<p>“Our leader was no good for the pack, causing trouble. Gon decided to challenge him and become the new leader. From the moment Gon told me of his plan, I already expected some cowardly trick. I told him as much, but he was resolute.</p>
<p>“When Gon issued the challenge, our leader named an outcrop of rock as the location, as was his right. Before the fight had even begun, our leader had the upper paw. Gon was backed against the edge of the cliff and lost his footing. He tried to claw his way back up, but the leader pushed him off. I tried to save him, but I was too late. Gon had fallen to his death. I attacked the leader in retaliation.”</p>

<p>“Over there is Hashi Hashi Hill,” Gabu says. “Once you’re past there, my pack won’t follow you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Jess says. “Without your help, I would never have made it this far.”</p>
<p>“It was no trouble,” Gabu says. “You won’t tell anyone about us, right?”</p>
<p>Jess looks between Gabu and Mei, smiling faintly. “Do you really think anyone would believe me? No, your secret is safe with me.”</p>
<p>He makes to leave, but Mei steps forward. “I think you did the right thing, standing up for your friend.”</p>
<p>“Mei…” Gabu says.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Jess says again. “I think the same.” He gives a short laugh. “To think that I would agree with a goat…” He takes another few steps. “Hey, before I go, can I ask you something?”</p>
<p>“What is it?” Gabu says.</p>
<p>“Are you going to stay living like this forever?” Gabu and Mei look at each other. Neither of them has an answer. “Well then, goodbye,” and he walks past the hill and out of sight.</p>

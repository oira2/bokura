The Full Moon
<p><center><strong>-- Part 1 --</strong></center></p>
<h1>Day 0: The Full Moon</h1>
<p>&ldquo;The moon&rsquo;s beautiful, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Gabu said.</p>
<p>Mei gazed at the giant orb of light as it gradually made its way into the heavens. He couldn&rsquo;t remember ever seeing the moon so bright or all-encompassing. Gradually, he began to feel a sense of calm wash over him, just as Gabu had described feeling so many times before. &ldquo;Yeah, it really is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gabu sat beside him atop the hill that had almost been the last place they would ever meet. He, too, stared at the moon with tear-filled eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting so long to watch the moonrise with you, Mei.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too, Gabu. But it was definitely worth the wait. Don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, and this is the best one ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the moon crept higher into the night sky, Mei thought back on all he and Gabu had been through, the memories they shared and cherished. Before meeting Gabu, Mei had never expected his life to turn so completely upside-down in so fantastic a way. And yet here he was, a goat sitting side-by-side with a wolf, on the verge of starting a whole new life together all by themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gabu?&rdquo; Mei said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re finally able to be together, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mei. And we&rsquo;ll always be together. I promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mei&rsquo;s heart swelled at hearing those words from someone who knew and accepted him in a way that not even his own herd did. He loved Gabu so, so much. A few months ago, on the clifftop where the two of them had taken their last look at the life they had left behind, Mei had almost admitted that to him. Instead, he had said to Gabu, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really glad I met you on that stormy night.&rdquo; Gabu had said, &ldquo;I feel the same way,&rdquo; and Mei believed his friend had understood. Now, on this most wonderful of nights, he finally felt ready to say it aloud. &ldquo;Gabu, I think I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you too, Mei,&rdquo; Gabu said without hesitation, the way one might to a close friend.</p>
<p>Mei faltered. &ldquo;I mean, I think I&rsquo;m in love with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Gabu&rsquo;s eyes remained fixed on the moon. &ldquo;You mean…like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve felt that way for a long time now.&rdquo; A gentle breeze rustled the grass. Gabu remained silent. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine if you don&rsquo;t...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I&rsquo;m in love with you too, Mei,&rdquo; Gabu said hurriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gabu…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We jumped into a river together. That&rsquo;s not something you do if you&rsquo;re just friends, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mei closed his eyes, took in a deep breath and let it out slowly. &ldquo;Gabu, please don&rsquo;t tell me that just because it&rsquo;s what you think I want to hear. If you&rsquo;re going to say that to me, I need you to be sure you mean it. Take some time to think about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mei.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite Gabu&rsquo;s not so satisfying response, Mei was glad to have said it. The events of the past few hours—the past few months, really—had almost meant that Mei would never get the chance to tell Gabu how he felt. He truly believed that Gabu loved him too, but Gabu needed time to realise that on his own, just as Mei had done.</p>
<p>Mei had known for a long time that his relationship with Gabu wasn&rsquo;t a normal friendship. He&rsquo;d been friends with Tapu and Mii since they were kids, but he wouldn&rsquo;t have given up his old life to run away with them like he did with Gabu.</p>
<p>Not for the first time, Mei thought about how much easier things would have been if he and Gabu were both goats. The thought of bringing Gabu home to meet his grandmother, of Gabu becoming friends with Tapu and Mii, always made him smile. Perhaps without the barrier of species between them, Gabu would have an easier time seeing Mei as more than a friend.</p>
<p>Mei was reminded of Kuro-san. During his visit to Sawa Sawa Mountain, Mei had suspected that Kuro-san was attracted to him. He&rsquo;d never voiced these feelings to Mei, and Mei would have turned him down had he done so, but he was notable as the only other male goat to have expressed an interest in Mei.</p>
<p>The news of Mei&rsquo;s betrayal might not have reached Para Para Fields yet. Mei considered the possibility of paying Kuro-san a visit. Without the imminent threat of wolves pursuing them, Gabu and Mei could take their time and go the long way around the mountain. As much as Mei enjoyed Gabu&rsquo;s company, he would rather have more than just one person to talk to. Having someone else with whom he could discuss his relationship with Gabu would also be nice, especially if things continued to be awkward between them.</p>
<p>The moon, now high in the sky, held Gabu and Mei&rsquo;s attention for much of the remaining night. Eventually, the two friends retired to the small cave embedded in the side of the hill. The shadow cast by the hill shrouded the cave in darkness and extended almost to the edge of the forest. The glistening moonlight, reflecting from the leaves of distant trees, was a sight almost as beautiful as the moonrise itself.</p>
